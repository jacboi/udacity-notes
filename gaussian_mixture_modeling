Gaussian mixture modeling

the use of Gaussian distributions to cluster data
seems really rad
much more complex methodology of clustering

initialization
covariance type : shape of gaussians
initialization : centroid of the gaussians


steps
- 1. initialize k gaussian distributions
- 2. soft cluser data "expectation"
    - calculate probability density function for each function
    - get gaussian distributions of membership for each point
- 3. re estimate the gaussians - maximization
    - calculate weighted average of the clusters
    - generates new centroid, mean, for cluser

- 4. evaluate log-liklihood to check for convergence
    - the higher the log liklihood output the closer to converged

- repeat from step 2 until converged

advantages:
- soft clusering : where memebership is not pure, multi membership
- cluster shape flexibility

disadvantages : sensitive to initialization values
- possible to conver to local optimum
- slow to converge
